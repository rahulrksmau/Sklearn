Loan Submission Machine Learning Problem (Analytical Vidya) : This Challenge is the prediction of whether a customer will pay his loads or not. This problem contain data of customerâ€™s knowledge and last loan submission history, based on that model will predict he/she will pay his/her loans on time or not.

Model used : Supervise Learning GBM, Decision Tree, Logical and Linear Regression. 
Datasets : https://github.com/rahulrksmau/Sklearn/blob/master/Test.csv , https://github.com/rahulrksmau/Sklearn/blob/master/Train.csv
Link : https://github.com/rahulrksmau/Sklearn

Steps done : creation of modified test and train dataset using feature engineering and data cleaning , model training, testing over train dataset, model accuracy, predicting the result for actual dataset at last creation of submission csv. 
Result :  GBM 79.5%
Decision Tree 96.6%
Logical Regression 98.5%
Linear Regression 19%
